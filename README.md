[Write Code that is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Extend.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43--------------------------------)

## Article Response: 
The article talks about how software engineers should write code that is **"easy to delete."** What the article means by this is that engineers should design their software in a way that allows outdated part to be removed without breaking the entire system. 

This idea slightly goes against the idea of making the software exstensible. This article suggest that coders should focus more on making code that can be easily replaced or removed in the future to avoid complex maintance and encourage simpler modifications in the future. 

## Comment from Lily Fu

I found the article’s perspective on writing "code that is easy to delete" really thought-provoking. While extensibility is often emphasized in software engineering, the idea of prioritizing deletability is a refreshing take. It makes a lot of sense—systems evolve, requirements change, and being able to remove or replace outdated parts without disrupting the whole system is crucial for long-term maintainability.

## Comment from Nyjur Majok
I find the part of the article discussing about Layering and Isolation for Flexibility very interesting. Instead of writing one system, break it into layers. It is important that we use complex and volatile parts isolated so that when changes happen, they don’t ruin the entire system.
