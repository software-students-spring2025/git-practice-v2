# Is There a Future for Software Engineers? The Impact of AI

article: https://brainhub.eu/library/software-developer-age-of-ai

I found this article particularly interesting because I think that as an aspiring software engineer, AI is completely changing the CS industry and making the industry feel more unstable. The article mentioned that ~30% of those surveyed think AI could replace their work. However, currently AI can used to improve efficiency on a multitude of tasks like bug detection, repetitive tasks, etc. In this way, AI can be used as a helpful tool for engineers in doing small tasks and saving time. The developers can then focus their energy to making complex code and other aspects of software development. With this shift in the industry, having an understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks may be increasingly helpful. Also being in classes that have focused more heavily on principle of coding, I realize I need to broaden my skill set to be able to evolve as quickly as the industry does.

### Comment by Felix Guo:
This article resonates with me as an aspiring software engineer. AI is transforming the CS industry, bringing both uncertainty and opportunity. It highlights the need to embrace tools like AI for efficiency while developing skills in areas like machine learning to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving field.
