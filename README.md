[Will AI take over Software Engineering?](https://medium.com/the-business-of-ai/will-ai-replace-software-engineers-a-30-year-veterans-perspective-f6f5cdfc2c94)

I found this article interesting because it approaches a very popular train of thought nowadays with the evolution of AI, and I tend to agree
with the author's point of view. The author, who is someone with 30 years of software engineering experience, explains that historical patterns
show that with frameworks like Rails and Django, similar sentiments arose: that anyone would be able to write software. However, that never happened.

AI just makes it much more efficient for people to create software. However, the key parts of software engineering, such as truly understanding the 
scope of problems, system design, and even related patterns like understanding marketing trends for software systems, will have to come down to 
actual people understanding what software is being created.

**Commented by ChuqiaoHuang:** I agree with the article that AI is a helpful tool rather than a replacement for software engineers. AI can handle simple coding tasks, but real engineers are still needed and will always needed for creativity, problem-solving, and making big decisions.
