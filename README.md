# Interesting SWE-related article
Link to article: https://www.itpro.com/software/development/maybe-we-arent-going-to-hire-anybody-this-year-marc-benioff-says-salesforce-might-not-hire-any-software-engineers-in-2025-as-the-firm-reaps-the-benefits-of-ai-agents

I was initially interested in this article's headline, which concerns Mark Benioff's casual comment that Salesforce might not hire any software engineers in 2025. I should not have been surprised-- agentic AI has grown popular, and it looks like it's here to stay. Increased productivity levels serve as incentive for the companies that have started using AI agents to continue using AI agents. The article states that you shouldn't start suddenly reconsidering your SWE career in reaction to this news, which I agree with. Though it is discouraging that large tech companies may not be hiring as many as they used to due to AI, there are still many, many companies there that need software engineers. 

The article pushes a perspective that AI may decrease career opportunities for software engineers, and they reference a Gartner study as evidence. However, in that study, Gartner themselves links another article (unfortunately paywalled) whose title is "“AI Will Not Replace Software Engineers (and May, in Fact, Require More)". This difference in predicted outcome is interesting, and I'm excited to see how the integration of AI changes the software engineering field in the coming years.
