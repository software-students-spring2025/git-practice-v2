### Why I Found This Article Interesting
This article talks about how the Software Engineering job market is changing/fluctuation since 2000. It mentions an initial period of slow growth from 2001 to 2004, then rapid growth after that until 2021, followed by a period of shrinking and slow growth. The article predicts that going forward into the rest of 2025 to 2026 and beyond there will be slow growth or flattening growth due to the trends of the past, however there is no telling for sure. The article then talks about the companies that other companies hire the most from, the main example being Google, showing that companies usually want to hire talent from top companies.
