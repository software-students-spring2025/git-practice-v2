## The article
[The hardest part of building software is not coding, itâ€™s requirements - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)

## Why I find this article interesting
I find it interesting since my preconceived notion of what it is to be a software engineer is predominately writing code. This is what I have been taught after taking six computer science courses - writing code in Python and Java, learning about data structures and algorithms, knowing how C code stores data in the memory etc. However, during my internship last summer, I found that I spent significantly more time discussing with my mentor and formulating what exactly I wanted and needed the code to do and why instead of actually writing the code. (And like the article suggested, at least some portion of the code I actually wrote came from AI.)

## I like it as well.
This article makes me happy because it illustrates another aspect of coding I never considered.
