Here's an article about how software development is revolutionizing the fashion industry: https://www.scrums.com/blog/fashion-meets-tech-a-future-of-fashion-software-development

The most interesting fact in this article is that incoporating software development into the fashion design process can improve sustainability.

With software, designers can digitaly fabricate pieces, reducing the need for physical samples. This would be great for the environment and business costs.
