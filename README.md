#This passage provides a great narrative on the evolution of Dune, highlighting its speed, flexibility, and improvements over Jenga. It effectively explains why Dune became the preferred build system, but it could benefit from clearer installation instructions, a quick-start example, and a feature comparison table between Jenga and Dune. Additionally, adding a roadmap and contribution guidelines would help engage the open-source community. Overall, itâ€™s well-written but could be more user-friendly for newcomers.


# I love your ideas in this article and you sharing. Have a good day.
